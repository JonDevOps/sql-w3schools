There are different versions of the SQL language. Also most versions have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.
 - All versions support the same majors commands in a similar manner: SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, and WHERE


SELECT * FROM Customers; // This selects all the records in the "Customers" table in your database.

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields.
    Field: a field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in a table.
    Record: also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table.

Records are the horizontal entities in the table. 
Fields are the vertical entities in a table that contains all info associated with a specific field in a table.

A database often contains more than one table. Each of which is identifiable by a name. Tables contain records (rows) with data.

SQL keywords are not case sensetive. So SELECT is the same as select.

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each statement.
